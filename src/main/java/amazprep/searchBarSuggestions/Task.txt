You have a search bar, like a Google, Amazon where user types what he wants to search for.
You need to implement datastructure that will provide list of suggestions for the users input.
Let's say there are brands: Amazon, Apple, Adidas, Adele.
User types "Ap" - suggestions is only "Apple",
user types "Ad" - > {"Adidad", "Adele"}.
User types "a" -> {Amazon, Apple, Adidas, Adele} is presented.
Which data structures would you use, or design your own. Provide pros and cons of those solutions.
